Project: Secure Kubernetes Deployment using GHCR and RBAC

Description:
Deployed a Kubernetes application using a private image from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
Configured ServiceAccount with imagePullSecrets to securely access private images
Applied RBAC to restrict permissions for the deployment workload
Debugged and resolved ImagePullBackOff issues by analyzing pod events and access scopes
Ensured secret isolation and namespace-level access control using best practices

💬 In Interviews, Say:
“I created a secure deployment pipeline using Kubernetes where my pod pulled a private container image from GHCR using imagePullSecrets linked to a ServiceAccount. 
I hit an ImagePullBackOff issue due to token scopes and fixed it by adjusting the GitHub PAT, recreating the secret in the right namespace, 
and using kubectl describe to analyze pod events.”
